# Codelation Webpack Toolkit

A collection of [webpack](https://webpack.github.io) loaders used by Codelation.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install codelation-webpack-toolkit --save-dev
```

## Why?

The tools we use for webpack builds are changing rapidly as we learn more and better take advantage of them,
so this package ensures the webpack tools we use remain consistent and up-to-date across applications.
